NPC AI SYSTEM
- Should be compatible and use (renamed) player movement logic and controller class

PHYSICS SYSTEM
- Look into Rigidbody.AddForce() and the difference between ForceModes

LOCK ON TARGETING SYSTEM
- Target validation happens on the ILockTarget side
    - some validation conditions get recorded (distance, angle to camera, LOS)
    - if valid, target is added to a list
- PlayerLockOnLogic takes list and determines current target based on recorded validation conditions
- Eventually this could be re-implemented with ECS without needing to re-do the whole character controller
